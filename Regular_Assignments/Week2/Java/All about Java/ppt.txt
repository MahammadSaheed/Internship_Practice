Editions of JAVA
Java standard edition
Java enterprise edition
Java micro edition

In Java has compiler, Interpreter and JVM 

Features of JAVA:-

Simple:-it is easy to learn
in this syntax and all are easy to understand.

Object-Oriented:- in here it simplify software development and maintain some rules
In object oriented has 4 types of principles:-
   1.Abstraction:-hiding unwanted data and show main data
   2.Inheritance:- one class to another
   3.Polymorphism:-one function that which perform many roles
   4.Encapsulation:- binding or securing of the data

Platform Independent:-we can write it anywhere.
 A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.
there are two components :-
     Runtime environment
     API(Application Programming Interface)

Portable:- it is that which carry the byte code, no need of implementation
byte code means it is instruction of JVM

Robust:-it is strong memory management
main it use exception handling and JVM used to collect unused variables.

Secure:-the name it self tells that security .virus free systems and also secured because of No explicit pointer.

Multi-Threaded:- Is like separate program and executing concurrently.
generally we can say that many task which complete once.

Distributed:-
Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. 
Java  ables to make access files calling the methods from any machine on the internet.

High performance:-
   its is a just-in-time compiler.
  java is faster because the bytecode is close to native code.
