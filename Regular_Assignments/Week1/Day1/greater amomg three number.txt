greater among three
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare three integer variables n1, n2, n3
Step 3: If n1 is greater than n2,
	        If n1 is greater than n3,
	            Print "n1 is largest"
	        Else
	            Print "n3 is largest"
	    Else
	        If n2 is greater than n3,
	            Print "n2 is largest"
	        Else
	            Print "n3 is largest"
